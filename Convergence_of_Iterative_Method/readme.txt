Written by : An Jihai 

This part if written in Java and can be run from command lines.

You can find all required data records at locations below:

1.The randomly generated 100 vectors would be shown on the console 
(because it is generated by method 'System.out.print()')

2.The Average Error of jacobi can be found in the text file at the root directory of part two
  "Convergence_of_Iterative_Method" (File: "Convergence_of_iterative_methods.txt")

3.The Average Error of gauss_seidel can be found in the text file at the root directory of part two
  "Convergence_of_Iterative_Method" (File: "Convergence_of_iterative_methods.txt")

3.The Average Error of average ration of iterations of jacobi and gauss_seidel can be found in a text file at the root directory of part two
  "Convergence_of_Iterative_Method" (File: "Convergence_of_iterative_methods.txt")

4.The scatterplot chart is in the Excel file ("Convergence of iterative methods data.xlsx")

5.The written part is in the Word file ("Convergence_of_iterative_methods.docx")
